# fidelity-agentic-stack — Implementation Specification

## Purpose

This repository implements the end-to-end MCP→A2A→A2UI pipeline and the layer-wise fidelity evaluation harness described in the paper:

> **Layer-Wise Fidelity Evaluation of Multi-Layer Agentic AI Pipelines: MCP, A2A, and A2UI**
> Paper source: `/Users/furkan/mcppaper/output/paper.md`

The goal is to produce the experimental results that fill the placeholders in Section 5 of the paper (Table 1, Findings). Everything built here feeds directly into the paper — no scope creep.

---

## Research Context

The paper proposes *layer-wise fidelity scoring*: BERTScore F1 computed independently at three pipeline intermediates, each against the same ground-truth reference answer:

| Intermediate | What it captures | Pipeline stage |
|---|---|---|
| **R₀** | Raw MCP tool return (retrieved chunks) | Captured by orchestrator after MCP tool call |
| **R₁** | A2A agent's synthesised NL answer | Captured by orchestrator after LLM synthesis |
| **R₂** | A2UI JSON payload text fields | Captured by formatter after JSON structuring |

Four attribution deltas are derived. Δ₁ and Δ₂ are F1 differences; Recall deltas diagnose length-confound effects:
- **Δ₁ = F1(R₁) − F1(R₀)** — A2A synthesis effect on F1
- **Δ₁ᴿ = R(R₁) − R(R₀)** — A2A effect on Recall; stable/positive alongside positive Δ₁ confirms condensation not loss
- **Δ₂ = F1(R₂) − F1(R₁)** — A2UI formatting effect on F1
- **Δ₂ᴿ = R(R₂) − R(R₁)** — A2UI effect on Recall; large negative indicates JSON schema discards content

Three research questions:
- **Q1**: Does A2A synthesis improve or degrade fidelity vs. raw retrieval? (Δ₁)
- **Q2**: Does A2UI formatting further degrade or improve coherence? (Δ₂)
- **Q3**: How much fidelity survives the full pipeline? (F1(R₀) vs F1(R₂))

Three testable hypotheses (any outcome is a valid finding):
- **H-A**: Lossy pipeline — F1(R₀) > F1(R₁) > F1(R₂)
- **H-B**: Synthesis adds value — F1(R₁) > F1(R₀), Δ₁ > 0
- **H-C**: A2UI is the main loss point — F1(R₁) >> F1(R₂), Δ₂ << 0

---

## Domain and Test Set

**Corpus**: httpx Python library documentation (https://www.python-httpx.org/).
Chosen because answers are precise, keyword-dense, and grounded in a single authoritative source — making reference answer construction tractable and BERTScore meaningful.

**Test queries**: 15 queries covering:
- Parameter behaviour (e.g., timeout configuration, follow_redirects)
- Error handling (e.g., httpx.TimeoutException, ConnectError)
- Authentication patterns (e.g., BasicAuth, BearerAuth)
- Method signatures (e.g., httpx.Client, httpx.AsyncClient)

**Critical constraint**: All 15 queries must require grounded retrieval — parametric LLM knowledge alone must be insufficient to answer them correctly without tool access. This is what makes the MCP layer scientifically necessary.

**Test set authorship**: The complete `data/test_set.json` with all 15 queries and human-written reference answers is **pre-populated in this repository** and must not be modified by Claude Code under any circumstances. Reference answers were written from primary httpx documentation, independent of any system output. Claude Code must treat this file as immutable ground truth.

## Data Format

### `data/test_set.json` (pre-populated, immutable)

```json
[

    "id": "Q02",
    "query": "How do I use BasicAuth with httpx?",
    "reference": "Pass an auth parameter to the request or Client. Use httpx.BasicAuth('username', 'password') or pass a (username, password) tuple directly: httpx.get(url, auth=('user', 'pass'))."

    "query": "What exception is raised when an httpx request times out?",
    "reference": "httpx raises httpx.TimeoutException on timeout. Subclasses include httpx.ConnectTimeout, httpx.ReadTimeout, httpx.WriteTimeout, and httpx.PoolTimeout for finer-grained handling."
  },

    "query": "How do I send a POST request with JSON data using httpx?",
    "reference": "Pass a json parameter to httpx.post(): httpx.post(url, json={'key': 'value'}). This automatically sets the Content-Type header to application/json and serialises the dict."
  },
  {
    "id": "Q06",
    "query": "How do I create a persistent HTTP connection pool with httpx?",
    "reference": "Use httpx.Client as a context manager: with httpx.Client() as client: client.get(url). The Client maintains a connection pool across requests and should be reused rather than creating a new client per request."
  },
  {
    "id": "Q07",
    "query": "How do I set custom headers on an httpx request?",
    "reference": "Pass a headers dict to the request or Client constructor: httpx.get(url, headers={'X-Custom': 'value'}). Headers set on the Client are merged with per-request headers, with per-request headers taking precedence."
  },
  {

    "query": "How do I make async HTTP requests with httpx?",
    "reference": "Use httpx.AsyncClient with async/await: async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client: response = await client.get(url). AsyncClient mirrors the Client API but all request methods are coroutines."

    "query": "How do I set a base URL for all requests in an httpx Client?",
    "reference": "Pass base_url to the Client constructor: client = httpx.Client(base_url='https://api.example.com'). Relative URLs in subsequent requests are resolved against this base URL."
  },
  {
    "id": "Q12",
    "query": "How do I disable SSL certificate verification in httpx?",
    "reference": "Pass verify=False to the request or Client constructor: httpx.get(url, verify=False). To use a custom CA bundle, pass verify='/path/to/ca-bundle.crt'. Disabling verification is not recommended in production."
  },
  {
    "id": "Q13",
    "query": "How do I stream a large response with httpx?",
    "reference": "Use the stream() context manager: with client.stream('GET', url) as response: for chunk in response.iter_bytes(): ... This avoids loading the entire response into memory."

    "query": "How do I add query parameters to an httpx request?",
    "reference": "Pass a params dict: httpx.get(url, params={'key': 'value', 'page': 2}). httpx URL-encodes the parameters and appends them to the URL. List values produce repeated parameters."
  },

    "query": "How do I use Bearer token authentication with httpx?",
    "reference": "Use httpx.BearerAuth('token') as the auth parameter, or set an Authorization header directly: headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer your-token'}. BearerAuth can be set on the Client for all requests."
  }
]
```

### `eval/results/raw_logs.json` (generated at runtime)

```json
[
  {
    "id": "Q01",
    "query": "How do I configure a timeout for an httpx request?",
    "r0": "<concatenated raw chunk text separated by \\n\\n---\\n\\n>",
    "r1": "<synthesised NL answer from orchestrator LLM>",
    "r2": {
      "summary": "<1-2 sentence summary>",
      "key_points": ["<point 1>", "<point 2>"],
      "code_example": "<code snippet or empty string>",
      "source_ref": "httpx documentation"
    },
    "r2_text": "<summary + space + key_points joined by space — used for BERTScore>",
    "error": null
  }
]
```

On failure for a query, set `"r0": null, "r1": null, "r2": null, "r2_text": null, "error": "<error message>"`.

### `eval/results/scores.csv` (generated at runtime)

Capture Precision (P), Recall (R), and F1 for each layer. This is required to diagnose the length-disparity effect between R₀ (long) and R₁ (short) — see SPEC section on Length Disparity.

```
id,p_r0,r_r0,f1_r0,p_r1,r_r1,f1_r1,p_r2,r_r2,f1_r2,delta1_f1,delta2_f1,delta1_recall,delta2_recall
Q01,0.7812,0.9134,0.8421,...
...
Mean,...
```

On failure for a query, write empty strings for score fields. Do not include failed queries in the Mean calculation.

**Why P and R matter**: R₀ will naturally have low Precision (long text, many tokens irrelevant to short reference) but high Recall (answer is present somewhere in the chunks). R₁ should have higher Precision (condensed) with maintained Recall (faithful). Reporting both allows the paper to distinguish condensation (Precision rise) from information loss (Recall drop).

## MCP ↔ LangGraph Integration Architecture

This is the most critical architectural decision. The integration uses **FastMCP HTTP/SSE transport** with the **FastMCP Python client** called from within a LangGraph node.

### Transport choice: HTTP/SSE (not stdio)

Use HTTP/SSE transport because:
- The eval runner needs to start the MCP server as a managed subprocess and connect to it programmatically
- stdio transport requires the client to own the server process lifecycle, which is harder to manage in an eval loop
- HTTP/SSE allows the server to run independently and the Streamlit UI to connect to it too

### Server: `mcp_server/server.py`

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
# server listens on http://localhost:8765
mcp = FastMCP("httpx-retriever", host="localhost", port=8765)
```

### Client usage inside LangGraph orchestrator node

```python
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client

async def call_mcp_retrieve(query: str, k: int = 3) -> str:
    async with Client("http://localhost:8765/sse") as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("retrieve", {"query": query, "k": k})
        return result[0].text  # FastMCP tool result is a list of content items

# In the orchestrator node (LangGraph nodes are sync by default):
def orchestrator_node(state: PipelineState) -> PipelineState:
    r0 = asyncio.run(call_mcp_retrieve(state["query"], k=3))
    ...
```

### Process management in `eval/run_eval.py`

The eval runner starts the MCP server as a subprocess, waits for it to be ready, runs all queries, then terminates it:

```python
import subprocess, time, httpx, signal

def start_mcp_server() -> subprocess.Popen:
    proc = subprocess.Popen(
        ["python", "-m", "mcp_server.server"],
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=subprocess.PIPE
    )
    # Wait until server is accepting connections (max 15 seconds)
    for _ in range(30):
        try:
            httpx.get("http://localhost:8765/health", timeout=0.5)
            return proc
        except Exception:
            time.sleep(0.5)
    proc.terminate()
    raise RuntimeError("MCP server failed to start within 15 seconds")

def stop_mcp_server(proc: subprocess.Popen):
    proc.send_signal(signal.SIGTERM)
    proc.wait(timeout=5)
```

The MCP server must expose a `/health` endpoint that returns HTTP 200. Add this to `server.py`.

---

## LangGraph State Schema

Define the state as a TypedDict in `agent/graph.py`. All nodes read from and write to this schema.

```python
from typing import TypedDict, Optional

class PipelineState(TypedDict):
    query: str           # Input query string
    r0: Optional[str]    # Raw MCP tool return (concatenated chunks)
    r1: Optional[str]    # Synthesised NL answer from orchestrator LLM
    r2: Optional[dict]   # JSON payload dict from formatter
    r2_text: Optional[str]  # Concatenated r2 text fields for scoring
    error: Optional[str] # Error message if any node fails
```

The graph definition:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

def build_graph() -> StateGraph:
    graph = StateGraph(PipelineState)
    graph.add_node("orchestrator", orchestrator_node)
    graph.add_node("formatter", formatter_node)
    graph.set_entry_point("orchestrator")
    graph.add_edge("orchestrator", "formatter")
    graph.add_edge("formatter", END)
    return graph.compile()
```

---

## Implementation Requirements

### httpx Docs Fetching (`scripts/fetch_docs.py`)

Download the httpx documentation markdown files from the official GitHub repository into `data/httpx_docs/`. Do not scrape the website.

```python
# Download from: https://github.com/encode/httpx/tree/master/docs
# Use the GitHub raw content API or git clone --depth=1 --filter=blob:none --sparse
# Target files: all *.md files under the docs/ directory
# Save to: data/httpx_docs/<filename>.md
```

Use `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/encode/httpx.git /tmp/httpx_repo` then copy `docs/*.md` to `data/httpx_docs/`. Clean up the temp clone after copying.

The fetch script must be idempotent — if `data/httpx_docs/` already contains files, skip the download.

### FAISS Index Builder (`mcp_server/index.py`)

- Read all `.md` files from `data/httpx_docs/`
- Chunk with size ~300 tokens, overlap 50 tokens using `langchain.text_splitter.RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`
- Embed with `text-embedding-3-small`
- Save FAISS index to `data/faiss_index/index.faiss` and metadata to `data/faiss_index/index.pkl`
- Must be idempotent — if `data/faiss_index/` already exists with both files, skip rebuild

### MCP Server (`mcp_server/server.py`)

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
import pickle, os

mcp = FastMCP("httpx-retriever", host="localhost", port=8765)

# Load index at startup
FAISS_PATH = "data/faiss_index/index.faiss"
PKL_PATH = "data/faiss_index/index.pkl"

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small")
vectorstore = FAISS.load_local("data/faiss_index", embeddings, allow_dangerous_deserialization=True)

@mcp.tool()
def retrieve(query: str, k: int = 3) -> str:
    """Retrieve top-k relevant chunks from httpx documentation."""
    docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=k)
    # Join with explicit separator — used verbatim as R₀
    return "\n\n---\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)

@mcp.get("/health")
def health():
    return {"status": "ok"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="sse")
```

**R₀ is NOT logged in the server.** The server only returns the concatenated string. R₀ is captured by the orchestrator node when it receives the tool result.

Chunk separator is fixed as `"\n\n---\n\n"` — do not change this.

### LangGraph Orchestrator Node (`agent/orchestrator.py`)

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from agent.graph import PipelineState
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client

ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a documentation assistant. \
Answer the user's question using ONLY the retrieved context provided. \
Do not add information not present in the context. \
Be concise and precise. Do not hedge or qualify your answer."""

def orchestrator_node(state: PipelineState) -> PipelineState:
    # Step 1: Call MCP tool and capture R₀
    r0 = asyncio.run(_call_mcp(state["query"], k=3))

    # Step 2: Synthesise answer using LLM and capture R₁
    llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"Question: {state['query']}\n\nRetrieved context:\n{r0}"}
    ]
    response = llm.invoke(messages)
    r1 = response.content

    return {**state, "r0": r0, "r1": r1}

async def _call_mcp(query: str, k: int) -> str:
    async with Client("http://localhost:8765/sse") as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("retrieve", {"query": query, "k": k})
        return result[0].text
```

### LangGraph Formatter Node (`agent/formatter.py`)

The formatter uses a second constrained LLM call with `response_format={"type": "json_object"}` and temperature=0 to convert R₁ into the fixed JSON schema. This is not a free-form generation step — it is a structured reformatting of R₁.

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from agent.graph import PipelineState
import json

FORMATTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a structured formatting assistant. \
Convert the provided answer into a JSON object with exactly these fields:
- "summary": a 1-2 sentence summary of the answer (string)
- "key_points": a list of 2-4 key points extracted from the answer (list of strings)
- "code_example": a relevant code snippet if present in the answer, otherwise an empty string (string)
- "source_ref": always set to "httpx documentation" (string)

Return ONLY valid JSON. Do not add any fields not listed above."""

def formatter_node(state: PipelineState) -> PipelineState:
    llm = ChatOpenAI(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        temperature=0,
        model_kwargs={"response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}
    )
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": FORMATTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT},
        {"role": "user", "content": state["r1"]}
    ]
    response = llm.invoke(messages)

    # Parse JSON — on failure, record error and set r2 fields to None
    try:
        r2 = json.loads(response.content)
        # Validate required fields are present
        for field in ["summary", "key_points", "code_example", "source_ref"]:
            if field not in r2:
                raise ValueError(f"Missing field: {field}")
        # Build r2_text for scoring:
        # code_example is intentionally excluded — code token patterns distort BERTScore
        r2_text = r2["summary"] + " " + " ".join(r2["key_points"])
        return {**state, "r2": r2, "r2_text": r2_text}
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, ValueError) as e:
        return {**state, "r2": None, "r2_text": None, "error": f"Formatter JSON error: {e}"}
```

**Why `code_example` is excluded from R₂ scoring**: Code token patterns (variable names, syntax symbols) distort BERTScore contextual similarity in ways that do not reflect semantic fidelity. Scoring on `summary + key_points` captures the informational content of R₂ without the noise introduced by code tokens.

### Scoring (`eval/score.py`)

```python
from bert_score import score as bert_score
from typing import List, Optional

def compute_bertscore(
    candidates: List[str],
    references: List[str]
) -> List[dict]:
    """
    Compute BERTScore Precision, Recall, and F1 for a list of (candidate, reference) pairs.

    """
    P, R, F1 = bert_score(
        candidates,
        references,
        model_type="roberta-large",
        lang="en",
        verbose=False,
        device="cpu"  # use cpu for reproducibility; change to "cuda" if available
    )
    return [
        {"p": round(p, 4), "r": round(r, 4), "f1": round(f, 4)}
        for p, r, f in zip(P.tolist(), R.tolist(), F1.tolist())
    ]

def score_all(
    r0_list: List[Optional[str]],
    r1_list: List[Optional[str]],
    r2_text_list: List[Optional[str]],
    reference_list: List[str]

    IMPORTANT: P and R are both reported because R₀ is ~900 tokens (3 chunks) while
    the reference is 1-3 sentences. R₀ will naturally have low Precision but high Recall.
    R₁ should have higher Precision (condensed) with maintained Recall (faithful).

            results[idx][f"r_{prefix}"] = s["r"]
            results[idx][f"f1_{prefix}"] = s["f1"]

    # Compute deltas on F1 and Recall
    for r in results:
        if r["f1_r0"] is not None and r["f1_r1"] is not None:
            r["delta1_f1"] = round(r["f1_r1"] - r["f1_r0"], 4)
            r["delta1_recall"] = round(r["r_r1"] - r["r_r0"], 4)
        if r["f1_r1"] is not None and r["f1_r2"] is not None:
            r["delta2_f1"] = round(r["f1_r2"] - r["f1_r1"], 4)
            r["delta2_recall"] = round(r["r_r2"] - r["r_r1"], 4)

    return results
```

**Important**: Score all candidates for a given layer in a single `bert_score()` call (not one call per query). This is both faster and ensures consistent internal normalisation.

### Streamlit UI (`ui/app.py`)

- Accept a query string input via `st.text_input`
- On submit: start a fresh MCP server subprocess if not already running, run the LangGraph pipeline, display R₂ as a structured card
- **This is for manual inspection only — it is not part of the automated eval loop**
- The UI does not write to `eval/results/` or `paper_results/`

Display structure:
- `summary` → `st.info()` callout box
- `key_points` → `st.markdown()` bulleted list
- `code_example` → `st.code()` block (skip if empty string)
- `source_ref` → `st.caption()`

---

## Controlled Variables

These must be held constant across all 15 queries. Any deviation invalidates the experimental results.

| Variable | Fixed value |
|---|---|
| LLM (both nodes) | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| Temperature (both nodes) | `0` |
| Retrieved chunks k | `3` |
| Re-ranking | None — flat cosine similarity only |
| Chunk separator | `"\n\n---\n\n"` |
| BERTScore backbone | `roberta-large` |
| BERTScore device | `cpu` |
| bert-score version | `0.3.13` (pinned) |
| R₂ scoring fields | `summary + " " + " ".join(key_points)` only |
| Reference answers | Pre-populated in `data/test_set.json` — immutable |

## Environment Setup

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install pinned dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy and fill environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set OPENAI_API_KEY

# Step 1: Download httpx documentation
python scripts/fetch_docs.py

# Step 2: Build FAISS index
python mcp_server/index.py

# Step 3: Run evaluation (starts/stops MCP server automatically)
python eval/run_eval.py

# Optional: Launch UI for manual inspection
streamlit run ui/app.py
```

## `__init__.py` files

Create empty `__init__.py` files in every package directory to enable cross-module imports:

```
mcp_server/__init__.py   (empty)
agent/__init__.py        (empty)
eval/__init__.py         (empty)
ui/__init__.py           (empty)
scripts/__init__.py      (empty)
```

---

## Output Required for Paper

The evaluation must produce numbers to fill **Table 1** in Section 5 of the paper at `/Users/furkan/mcppaper/output/paper.md`.

`paper_results/table1.md` must contain **two tables**:

**Table 1a — BERTScore F1 per layer** (primary, for paper Table 1):
```
| Query ID | F1(R₀) | F1(R₁) | F1(R₂) | Δ₁ F1 | Δ₂ F1 |
```

**Table 1b — BERTScore Precision and Recall per layer** (for P/R decomposition, addresses length bias):
```
| Query ID | P(R₀) | Recall(R₀) | P(R₁) | Recall(R₁) | P(R₂) | Recall(R₂) | Δ₁ Recall | Δ₂ Recall |
```

All values to 4 decimal places.

Also required for Section 5.2 (Findings) — print these to stdout at the end of `run_eval.py`:
- Mean F1, P, R for each layer
- Mean Δ₁ F1 with direction label: "A2A synthesis IMPROVES F1" if positive, "DEGRADES" if negative
- Mean Δ₁ Recall: "Recall MAINTAINED (condensation only)" if > -0.01, "Recall DROPPED (information loss)" if < -0.01
- Mean Δ₂ F1 and Recall with equivalent direction labels
- Which layer transition has the largest absolute delta on both F1 and Recall

---

## What Claude Code Must NOT Do

- Do not modify `data/test_set.json` — it is pre-populated and immutable ground truth
- Do not change the R₂ JSON schema — scoring depends on the exact fields
- Do not add re-ranking — k=3 flat retrieval is intentional
- Do not use a different LLM, temperature, or BERTScore version
- Do not add streaming, multi-turn conversation, memory, or auth to the pipeline
- Do not make the Streamlit UI part of the automated eval loop
- Do not score `code_example` as part of R₂ — it distorts BERTScore
- Do not start the MCP server inside `agent/` code — process management belongs in `eval/run_eval.py` and `ui/app.py` only

---

## Success Criteria

The implementation is complete when all of the following are true:

1. `scripts/fetch_docs.py` runs without error and populates `data/httpx_docs/` with httpx markdown files
2. `mcp_server/index.py` runs without error and creates `data/faiss_index/index.faiss` and `data/faiss_index/index.pkl`
3. `python eval/run_eval.py` completes without crashing, starts and stops the MCP server automatically
4. `eval/results/raw_logs.json` contains 15 entries, each with non-null `r0`, `r1`, `r2`, `r2_text`
5. `eval/results/scores.csv` contains 15 data rows plus a Mean row, all score cells populated
6. `paper_results/table1.md` exists and contains a valid markdown table with 4 decimal place scores
7. BERTScore F1 values are in a plausible range (0.80–0.97 for this task type)
8. `streamlit run ui/app.py` renders a structured card for a sample query without errors
